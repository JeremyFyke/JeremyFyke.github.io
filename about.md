I am a research scientist in climate modeling, working at the Center for Ocean, Sea Ice and Land Ice Modeling, in the Theoretial Division of [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://lanl.gov/).  I'm involved in development and use of the [Community Earth System Model](http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/) (CESM), the [Accelerated Climate Model for Energy](http://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/accelerated-climate-modeling-energy) (ACME), the [University Earth System Model](http://climate.uvic.ca/model/) (UVic ESCM) and the Cumulative Emissions Projection Model (CEPM).  I am Topical Editor at [Geoscientific Model Development](http://www.geoscientific-model-development.net/) and Scientific Liaison for the [Land Ice Working Group](http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/liwg).  

My interests are primarily in modeling the coupled ice-sheet/climate system, which today includes the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.  The primary question I am helping to answer is: how will future sea level change due to human forced ice sheet loss?  This involves a comprehensive understanding of the coupling between atmosphere, oceans, land surface, biology, carbon cycle and human society.
