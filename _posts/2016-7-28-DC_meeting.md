I recently attended the American Meteorological Society's annual 2-week Summer Policy Colloquium.  This was one of the best workshops I've ever attended!  Presenters described how 'policy for science' (i.e. policy which determines national science objectives) and 'science for policy' (i.e. science that determines national policy objectives) work/don't work.  Critical information, as climate science becomes ever-more politicized by special interest groups.
