title: Attended La Jolla IGS Meeting
---

Last week I attended the International Glaciological Society Meeting at Scripps
Oceanography Institute in La Jolla, California.  Great to get caught up on both
the rapidly expanding set of observational datasets of critical Antarctic and
Greenland glaciers, and also on the emerging field of coupled ice-sheet/ocean
modeling.  Both important for improving projections of future sea level rise.
