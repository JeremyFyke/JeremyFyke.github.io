**I am a research scientist in climate modeling** working at the Center for Ocean, Sea Ice and Land Ice Modeling, in the Theoretial Division of [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://lanl.gov/).  I'm involved in development and use of the [Community Earth System Model](http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/) (CESM), the [Accelerated Climate Model for Energy](http://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/accelerated-climate-modeling-energy) (ACME), the [University Earth System Model](http://climate.uvic.ca/model/) (UVic ESCM) and the Cumulative Emissions Projection Model (CEPM).  I am Topical Editor at [Geoscientific Model Development](http://www.geoscientific-model-development.net/) and Scientific Liaison for the [Land Ice Working Group](http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/liwg).  

**My primary research focus** is the coupled ice-sheet/climate system, which today includes the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.  The primary question I am helping to answer is: how will future sea level change due to human forced ice sheet loss?  Answering this involves  understanding the coupling between atmosphere, oceans, land surface, biology, carbon cycle and human society, and simulation of this coupling within comprehensive Earth System models.

**Secondary research interests** include:

- anthropogenic carbon emission scenarios, which are crucial determinants of long-term climate change.  
- climate services, i.e. the practical interaction of climate science with society.
- paleoclimate/carbon cycle interactions, particularly tectonically-driven interactions around times of ice sheet inception.
- climate science communication, to efficiently counter false information generated by well-funded climate deniers.
